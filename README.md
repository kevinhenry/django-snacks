Overview: Today we’ll be tackling a cryptographic classic - the Caesar Cipher.

Your job will be to devise a method to encrypt a message that can then be decrypted when supplied with the corresponding key.

But don’t stop there! You’ll also need to devise a way to decipher the encrypted message event when you do NOT have the key!

## Feature Tasks and Requirements
- Create a web site in Django with 2 pages
    - home page
    - about page
    - create views/urls/templates as needed for home and about pages
    - use ancestor template to contain navigation elements
    - Should be built the “Django way” aka match the structure of in-class demo

    - create project
    - define app
    - add app to project
